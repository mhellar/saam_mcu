                <p>We know what a computer looks like. It usually has a keyboard, monitor, CPU (Central Processing Unit), printer, and a mouse. These types of computers, like the Mac or PC, are primarily designed to communicate (or “interface”) with humans.

                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>We call these devices “microcontrollers”. Micro because they’re small, and controller because they “control” machines, gadgets, whatever!
                    <br><br> They’re cool because, you can build a machine or device, write programs to control it and then let it work for you automatically. And they are cheap!</p>

                <h4>WHAT IS ARDUINO:</h4>
                <p>Arduino is an open source physical computing platform based on a simple input/output (I/O) board and a development environment that implements the Processing language (www.processing.org).<br><br> Arduino can be used to develop standalone
                    interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (such as Flash, Processing, NodeJS or Max/MSP). !

                <h3>Arduino is composed of two major parts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Arduino board, which is the piece of hardware you program to control your projects.</li>
                    <li>The Arduino IDE, the piece of software you run on your computer. You use the IDE to create a sketch(a program) that you upload to the Arduino board. The sketch tells the board what to do.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>ARDUINO TERMS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>“sketch” – a program you write to run on an Arduino board</li>
                    <li>“pin” – an input or output connected to something. e.g. output to an LED, input from a knob.</li>
                    <li>“digital” – value is either HIGH or LOW. (aka on/off, one/zero) e.g. switch state</li>
                    <li>“analog” – value ranges, usually from 0-255. e.g. LED brightness, motor speed, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <p>The Arduino board is a microcontroller board, which is a small circuit (the board) that contains a whole computer on a small chip (the micro- controller). This computer is at least a thousand times less powerful than the MacBook I’m using
                    to write this, but it’s a lot cheaper and very useful to build interesting devices. !
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <p>The Arduino design team have placed on this board all of the components that are required for this micro controller to work properly and to communicate with your computer. There are many versions of this board; the one we’ll use throughout
                    this book is the Arduino Uno, which is the simplest one to use and the best one for learning on.</p>
            </section>

                <img src="img/iopins1.png" height="400"><br>
                <p>These can be inputs or outputs, which is specified by the sketch you create in the IDE.</p>

                <img src="img/apins.png" height="400"><br>
                <p>These dedicated analogue input pins take analog values (i.e., voltage readings from a sensor) and convert them into a number between 0 and 1023 we’ll look at this next class</p>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <img src="img/aopins.png" height="400"><br>
                <p>These are actually six of the digital pins that can be reprogrammed for analog output we’ll look at this in the next class</p>

                    <li>Like a text editor</li>
                    <li>View/write/edit sketches</li>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO SOFTWARE (IDE)</h4>
                <p>The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a program running on your computer that allows you to write sketches for the Arduino board in a simple language modeled after the Processing (www.processing.org) language.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>THE ARDUINO SOFTWARE (IDE)</h4>
                <p>The magic happens when you press the button that uploads the sketch to the board: the code that you have written is translated into the C language (which is generally quite hard for a beginner to use), and is compiled into a language that
                    the micro controller understands.
                    <br><br> This last step is quite important, because it’s where Arduino makes your life easy by hiding away as much as possible of the complexities of programming microcontrollers.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>The programming cycle on Arduino is basically as follows:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plug your board into a USB port on your computer.</li>
                    <li>Write a sketch that will make your board do something.</li>
                    <li>Upload this sketch to the board through the USB connection and wait a couple of seconds for the board to restart.</li>
                    <li>The board executes the sketch that you wrote.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>LESSON 1 - BASIC HOUSEKEEPING</h4>
                <p>This first lesson won't really teach programming the Arduino. It’s meant to introduce you to building a basic electrical circuit.
                    <br><br> It will also get us prepped for building the rest of the exercises throughout the class.</p>

                <p>5 Volts is too much electricity for the LED and will burn it out!</p>

                    own sketches!

                <h4>CODE:STEP BY STEP</h4>

                <p>Arduino expects two functions to exists—one called
                    <b>setup()</b> and one called <b>loop()</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>setup()</b> is where you put all the code that you want to execute once at the beginning of your program
                    <br><br>
                    <b>loop()</b> contains the core of your program, which is executed over and over again.
                    <br><br> When you power up the board, the code runs; when you want to stop, you just turn it off.</p>
            </section>


            <section>

                <p><b>// Example 01 : Blinking LED()</b><br> A comment is a useful way for us to write little notes. The preceding title comment just reminds us that this program, Example 01, blinks an LED.</p>
            </section>






            <section>
                <p><b>void setup()</b><br> This line tells Arduino that the next function will be called setup().</p>
            </section>




            <section>
                <b>{</b> With this opening curly bracket, a block of code begins.
                <br><br>
                <b>pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // sets the digital // pin as output</b>
                <br><br> pinMode tells Arduino how to configure a certain pin. Digital pins can be used either as INPUT or OUTPUT.
                <br><br> In this case, we need an output pin to control our LED, so we place the number of the pin and its mode inside the parentheses.
                <br><br> pinMode is a function, and the words (or numbers) specified inside the parentheses are arguments. INPUT and OUTPUT are constants in the Arduino language.
                <b>}</b>
                </p>

                <b>void loop()
{
<br><br>
loop()</b> is where you specify the main behavior of your interactive device. It will be repeated over and over again until you switch the board off.</b>

                    <b>digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turns the LED on</b>
                    <br><br> As the comment says, digitalWrite() is able to turn on (or off) any pin that has been configured as an OUTPUT.
                    <br><br> The first argument (in this case, LED) specifies which pin should be turned on or off (remember that LED is a constant value that refers to pin 13, so this is the pin that’s switched).
                    <br><br> The second argument can turn the pin on (HIGH) or off (LOW).</b>

                    Imagine that every output pin is a tiny power socket, like the ones you have on the walls of your apartment. American ones are 110 V, and Arduino works at a more modest 5 V.
                    <br><br> The magic here is when software becomes hardware. When you write digitalWrite(LED, HIGH), it turns the output pin to 5 V, and if you connect an LED, it will light up.
                    <br><br> So at this point in your code, an instruction in software makes something happen in the physical world by controlling the flow of electricity to the pin. Turning on and off the pin at will now let us translate these into something
                    more visible for a human being; the LED is our actuator</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    <b>delay(1000); // wait for a second</b><br><br> Arduino has a very basic structure. Therefore, if you want things to happen with a certain regularity, you tell it to sit quietly and do nothing until it is time to go to the next step.
                    delay() basically makes the processor sit there and do nothing for the amount of milliseconds that you pass as an argument. Milliseconds are thousands of seconds; therefore, 1000 milliseconds equals 1 second. So the LED stays on for
                    one second here.

            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    <b>digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turns the LED off</b><br><br> This instruction now turns off the LED that we previously turned on. Why do we use HIGH and LOW? Well, it’s an old convention in digital electronics. HIGH means that the pin
                    is on, and in the case of Arduino, it will be set at 5 V. LOW means 0 V. You can also replace these arguments mentally with ON and OFF.

                <p>
                    <b>delay(1000); // wait for a second</b><br><br> Here, we delay for another second. The LED will be off for one second.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>}</b><br> This closing curly bracket marks end of the loop function.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>Before we move on to the next section, I want you to play with the code. For example, reduce the amount of delay, using different numbers for the on and off pulses so that you can see different blinking patterns.
                    <br><br> In particular, you should see what happens when you make the delays very small, but use different delays for on and off . . . there is a moment when something strange happens; this “something” will be very useful when we learn
                    about somethng called pulse-width modulation.

                Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital control is used to create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages in between full on (5 Volts)
                and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on versus the time that the signal spends off. The duration of "on time" is called the pulse width.
            </section>
            <section>
                In the graphic below, the green lines represent a regular time period. This duration or period is the inverse of the PWM frequency. In other words, with Arduino's PWM frequency at about 500Hz, the green lines would measure 2 milliseconds each. A call
                to analogWrite() is on a scale of 0 - 255, such that analogWrite(255) requests a 100% duty cycle (always on), and analogWrite(127) is a 50% duty cycle (on half the time) for example.
