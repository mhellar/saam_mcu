                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>We know what a computer looks like. It usually has a keyboard, monitor, CPU (Central Processing
                    Unit),
                    printer, and a mouse. These types of computers, like the Mac or PC, are primarily designed to
                    communicate
                    (or “interface”) with humans.
                </p>

                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>There are also small computers all around,quietly running programs and quietly doing calculations.
                    These
                    computers are in your car, on the Space Shuttle, a small toy, and maybe even inside your
                    refrigerator.</p>

                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>It has built in "I/O" (input/output) capabilities. So it can read and write digital and analog
                    values/states, and connect directly to the "real world". A microcontroller, unlike a microprocessor
                    can connect directly to switches, buttons, LCD displays, LEDS, relays and serial ports

                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>Microcontrollers are generally used for low to medium complexity, specific tasks in equipment. This
                    contrasts with the powerful, number crunching microprocessors used in PCs which handle a variety of
                    software applications.

                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>Microcontrollers are often used in portable devices which run on batteries, e.g. digital cameras. So
                    they are often low powered with a small current consumption (unlike the heat sinked, fan cooled
                    microprocessor in a desktop computer)

                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>Compared to the microprocessor in a PC, the RAM within a microcontroller can typically range from
                    4mb down to as little as 1k

                <h4>WHAT IS A MICROCONTOLLER:</h4>
                <p>The program in a microcontroller is usually stored in EPROM or EEPROM. This is a type of non
                    volatile (program doesn't disappear when the device is turned off) memory which can be continuously
                    wiped and rewritten.

                <h3>Arduino is composed of two major parts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Arduino board, which is the piece of hardware you program to control your projects.</li>
                    <li>The Arduino IDE, the piece of software you run on your computer. You use the IDE to create a
                        sketch(a
                        program) that you upload to the Arduino board. The sketch tells the board what to do.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>ARDUINO TERMS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>“sketch” – a program you write to run on an Arduino board</li>
                    <li>“pin” – an input or output connected to something. e.g. output to an LED, input from a knob.</li>
                    <li>“digital” – value is either HIGH or LOW. (aka on/off, one/zero) e.g. switch state</li>
                    <li>“analog” – value ranges, usually from 0-255. e.g. LED brightness, motor speed, etc.</li>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <p>The Arduino board is a microcontroller board, which is a small circuit (the board) that contains a
                    whole
                    computer on a small chip (the micro- controller). This computer is at least a thousand times less
                    powerful
                    than the MacBook I’m using to write this, but it’s a lot cheaper and very useful to build
                    interesting
                    devices.

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <p>The Arduino design team have placed on this board all of the components that are required for this
                    micro
                    controller to work properly and to communicate with your computer. There are many versions of this
                    board;
                    the one we’ll use throughout this book is the Arduino Uno, which is the simplest one to use and the
                    best
                    one for learning on.</p>
            </section>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <img src="img/iopins1.png" height="400"><br>
                <p>These can be inputs or outputs, which is specified by the sketch you create in the IDE.</p>
            </section>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <img src="img/apins.png" height="400"><br>
                <p>These dedicated analogue input pins take analog values (i.e., voltage readings from a sensor) and
                    convert
                    them into a number between 0 and 1023 we’ll look at this next class</p>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <img src="img/aopins.png" height="400"><br>
                <p>These are actually six of the digital pins that can be reprogrammed for analog output we’ll look at
                    this
                    in the next class</p>

                <h4>THE ARDUINO HARDWARE</h4>
                <img src="img/ppins.png" height="350"><br>
                <p>These power pins are capable or providing 5.5 volts or 3.3 volts of power. Also there are two pins
                    that
                    are capable of providing ground any components that you attach to the controller.</p>

                <img src="img/usb.png" height="350"><br>
                <p>The USB connector connects the controller to you computer allowing you to program it. The USB
                    connection
                    also provides power.</p>

                <ul>

                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>THE ARDUINO SOFTWARE (IDE)</h4>
                <p>The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a program running on your computer that allows you
                    to
                    write sketches for the Arduino board in a simple language modeled after the Processing
                    (www.processing.org)
                    language.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>THE ARDUINO SOFTWARE (IDE)</h4>
                <p>The magic happens when you press the button that uploads the sketch to the board: the code that you
                    have
                    written is translated into the C language (which is generally quite hard for a beginner to use),
                    and
                    is compiled into a language that the micro controller understands.
                    <br><br> This last step is quite important, because it’s where Arduino makes your life easy by
                    hiding
                    away as much as possible of the complexities of programming microcontrollers.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h4>The programming cycle on Arduino is basically as follows:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plug your board into a USB port on your computer.</li>
                    <li>Write a sketch that will make your board do something.</li>
                    <li>Upload this sketch to the board through the USB connection and wait a couple of seconds for the
                        board
                        to restart.</li>
                    <li>The board executes the sketch that you wrote.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>LESSON 1 - BASIC HOUSEKEEPING</h4>
                <p>This first lesson won't really teach programming the Arduino. It’s meant to introduce you to
                    building
                    a basic electrical circuit.
                    <br><br> It will also get us prepped for building the rest of the exercises throughout the class.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>This lesson will basically get you up and running using the Arduino software and uploading a sketch
                    to
                    the Arduino board. Once you've completed this step we can continue to the really interesting stuff,
                    which
                    is when we start writing our own sketches!

                <h4>CODE:STEP BY STEP</h4>

                <p>Arduino expects two functions to exists—one called
                    <b>setup()</b> and one called <b>loop()</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>setup()</b> is where you put all the code that you want to execute once at the beginning of your
                    program
                    <br><br>
                    <b>loop()</b> contains the core of your program, which is executed over and over again.
                    <br><br> When you power up the board, the code runs; when you want to stop, you just turn it off.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p><b>// Example 01 : Blinking LED()</b><br> A comment is a useful way for us to write little notes.
                    The
                    preceding title comment just reminds us that this program, Example 01, blinks an LED.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><b>void setup()</b><br> This line tells Arduino that the next function will be called setup().</p>

            <section>
                <b>{</b> With this opening curly bracket, a block of code begins.
                <br><br>
                <b>pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // sets the digital // pin as output</b>
                <br><br> pinMode tells Arduino how to configure a certain pin. Digital pins can be used either as INPUT
                or
                OUTPUT.
                <br><br> In this case, we need an output pin to control our LED, so we place the number of the pin and
                its
                mode inside the parentheses.
                <br><br> pinMode is a function, and the words (or numbers) specified inside the parentheses are
                arguments.
                INPUT and OUTPUT are constants in the Arduino language.
                <b>}</b>

                    <br><br> loop()
                </b> is where you specify the main behavior of your interactive device. It will be repeated over and
                over
                again until you switch the board off.</b>

                    <b>digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turns the LED on</b>
                    <br><br> As the comment says, digitalWrite() is able to turn on (or off) any pin that has been
                    configured
                    as an OUTPUT.
                    <br><br> The first argument (in this case, LED) specifies which pin should be turned on or off
                    (remember
                    that LED is a constant value that refers to pin 13, so this is the pin that’s switched).
                    <br><br> The second argument can turn the pin on (HIGH) or off (LOW).</b>
                </p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    Imagine that every output pin is a tiny power socket, like the ones you have on the walls of your
                    apartment. American ones
                    are 110 V, and Arduino works at a more modest 5 V.
                    <br><br> The magic here is when software becomes hardware. When you write digitalWrite(LED, HIGH),
                    it
                    turns the output pin to 5 V, and if you connect an LED, it will light up.
                    <br><br> So at this point in your code, an instruction in software makes something happen in the
                    physical
                    world by controlling the flow of electricity to the pin. Turning on and off the pin at will now let
                    us
                    translate these into something more visible for a human being; the LED is our actuator</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    <b>delay(1000); // wait for a second</b><br><br> Arduino has a very basic structure. Therefore, if
                    you
                    want things to happen with a certain regularity, you tell it to sit quietly and do nothing until it
                    is
                    time to go to the next step. delay() basically makes the processor sit there and do nothing for the
                    amount
                    of milliseconds that you pass as an argument. Milliseconds are thousands of seconds; therefore,
                    1000
                    milliseconds equals 1 second. So the LED stays on for one second here.

                    <b>digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turns the LED off</b><br><br> This instruction now turns off the LED
                    that
                    we previously turned on. Why do we use HIGH and LOW? Well, it’s an old convention in digital
                    electronics.
                    HIGH means that the pin is on, and in the case of Arduino, it will be set at 5 V. LOW means 0 V.
                    You
                    can also replace these arguments mentally with ON and OFF.

                    <b>delay(1000); // wait for a second</b><br><br> Here, we delay for another second. The LED will be
                    off
                    for one second.

            <section>
                <p>Before we move on to the next section, I want you to play with the code. For example, reduce the
                    amount
                    of delay, using different numbers for the on and off pulses so that you can see different blinking
                    patterns.
                    <br><br> In particular, you should see what happens when you make the delays very small, but use
                    different
                    delays for on and off . . . there is a moment when something strange happens; this “something” will
                    be
                    very useful when we learn about somethng called pulse-width modulation.

            <section>
                Pulse Width Modulation, or PWM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. Digital
                control is used to
                create a square wave, a signal switched between on and off. This on-off pattern can simulate voltages
                in
                between full on (5 Volts) and off (0 Volts) by changing the portion of the time the signal spends on
                versus
                the time that the signal spends off. The duration of "on time" is called the pulse width.
            </section>
            <section>
                In the graphic below, the green lines represent a regular time period. This duration or period is the
                inverse of the PWM
                frequency. In other words, with Arduino's PWM frequency at about 500Hz, the green lines would
                measure 2
                milliseconds
                each. A call to analogWrite() is on a scale of 0 - 255, such that analogWrite(255) requests a 100% duty
                cycle
                (always on), and analogWrite(127) is a 50% duty cycle (on half the time) for example.

                The word serial means "one after the other." For example, a serial killer doesn't stop with one murder,
                but stabs many people one after the other. Serial data transfer is when we transfer data one bit at a
                time, one right after the other.
            </section>
            <section>
                Information is passed back & forth between the computer and Arduino by, essentially, setting a pin high
                or low. Just like we used that technique to turn an LED on and off, we can also send data. One side
                sets the pin and the other reads it. It's a little like Morse code, where you can use dits and dahs to
                send messages by telegram. In this case, instead of a long cable, its only a few feet.

                The baud rate is the rate at which information is transferred in a communication channel. In the serial
                port context, "9600 baud" means that the serial port is capable of transferring a maximum of 9600 bits
                per second.

                Stepper motors are DC motors that move in discrete steps. They have multiple coils that are organized
                in groups called "phases". By energizing each phase in sequence, the motor will rotate, one step at a
                time.

                With a computer controlled stepping you can achieve very precise positioning and/or speed control. For
                this reason, stepper motors are the motor of choice for many precision motion control applications.
